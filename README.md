# Hypothesis Testing

# Conclusion

We really enjoyed this project. We would like to encourage other students (everyone is a student) to check out online resources and try to do a project like this on your own with the same or another dataset! Real life data is messy, cleaning was paramount, little changes to outlier removal dramatically changed p-value results in our hypothesis test. It is always good to document your process for replicability and so you ensure your steps are logical. Lastly doing it with a friend makes it extra fun!

Sincerely, 
Eduardo and Trey
